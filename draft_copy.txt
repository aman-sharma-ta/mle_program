No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, 
it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. 
If you use your computer’s start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or documents directory instead. 
You can change this by navigating to another directory the first time you ‘Save As…’
